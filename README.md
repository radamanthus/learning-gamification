# Learning Gamification

How do you move a mountain? One rock at a time.

For many people, breaking down a long arduous task into smaller bite-sized pieces helps. Setting milestones helps, too. This has been boiled down almost to a science by game studios. In all the games they make, they find the sweet spot between being too hard and being too easy and not challenging. The trick is in finding a learning curve that is not too steep (too hard) or too slow (too easy). And in setting up milestones along the path. Do you recall that endorphin rush you get whenever your RPG character reaches a new level? The game designers designed for that.

I want to gamify my own learning journey, but I don't want to be dependent on the MOOC platforms like Coursera and Udacity. I want to use my own custom learning materials, and still be able to gamify my learning journeys. This repository is my attempt at achieving that.
